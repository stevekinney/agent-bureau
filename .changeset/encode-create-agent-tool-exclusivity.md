`createAgent`'s standalone `CreateAgentOptions` now encodes `tools`/`toolbox`/`permissions` exclusivity at the type level: `tools` + `toolbox`, `toolbox` + `permissions`, and all three together are now compile-time errors, matching the existing runtime guard. `tools`, `permissions`, `tools` + `permissions`, and `toolbox` alone remain valid, as does passing no tool configuration, including when `tools`/`permissions` are forwarded as already-optional (`T | undefined`-typed) values.

`CreateAgentOptions` is now a `type` (a union-based intersection), not an `interface` — a consumer that previously wrote `interface MyOptions extends CreateAgentOptions` for the full options bag needs `type MyOptions = CreateAgentOptions & { ... }` instead. Extending or declaration-merging onto just the non-exclusive fields (`generate`, `instructions`, `stopWhen`, etc.) still works via the newly exported `CreateAgentOptionsBase` interface.
